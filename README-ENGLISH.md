* AppOS: The main framework for developing CrazyCube firmware


## About
The `CrazyCube Application System` (code name: CrazyCube) is a firmware system developed for the `è¶…çº§ç«‹æ–¹è±†Â®`(English name CrazyCube). The majority of the project code is written in C++.

## Compilation and Configuration

1. IDE

   [VSCode + PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

2. Project configuration
   - Download third-party dependent libraries: Wait for the third-party library dependency download to complete when you first open the project (it will be downloaded to the `.pio/libdeps/CrazyCube` directory automatically).
   - Modify third-party library configuration: Copy all files under the **conf_lib** directory to the corresponding directory of the third-party library (for details, see `conf_lib/README.md`):
      * For example, copy `conf_lib/lvgl/lv_conf.h` to (overwrite the original file) `.pio/libdeps/CrazyCube/lvgl/lv_conf.h`, etc.

3. Compilation and running
   * Execute `Upload` to upload the code to the Cube Bean
   * Execute `Upload Filesystem Image` to upload file resources to the Cube Bean
   * Congratulations, all tasks are completed ðŸŽ‰
